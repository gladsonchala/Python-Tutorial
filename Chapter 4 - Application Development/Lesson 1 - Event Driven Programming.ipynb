Until one is received, our program can make no progress. When the operating system receives input, and Python’s internals determine it’s a line, `sys.stdin.readline()` resumes our program by returning that data to it. This resumption is the event that drives our program forward. Even this simple program, then, can be understood as an event-driven one.\n"

    "This version of our program presents the user with two `buttons`, either of which can generate an independent `click` event. This differs from our previous program, where only `sys.stdin.readline` could generate the single “line ready” event. We cope with the possible occurrence of either button’s event by associating event handlers with each one. `Tkinter` `buttons` accept a callable command to invoke when they are `clicked`. When the button labeled “Say Hello” generates a click event, that event drives our program to call `Application.sayHello`. This, in turn, outputs a line consisting of Hello to a scrollable `text widget`. The same process applies to the button labeled “Say Hello” and `Application.sayWorld`."

A loop that monitors event sources and dispatches their associated handlers is typical of `event-driven` programs and is known as an `event loop`."
